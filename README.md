# {metæffekt} Documentation
Repository for aggregating and dispatching com.metaeffekt.documentation around metaeffekt tools, plugins and more.

## {metæffekt} Universe

The [{metæffekt} Universe](metaeffekt-universe/README.md) is a knowledge database covering licenses and exceptions (terms) following defined strategies and objectives. 
The underlying concept is to provide a terms database that enables a scanner to deterministically identify licenses and license exceptions in binary and source artifacts.


## {metæffekt} Portfolio Manager

The [{metæffekt} Portfolio Manager](metaeffekt-portfolio-manager/README.md) provides a simple and structured way to manage software-related documents—such as SBOMs and reports—while serving as a core component in an API-driven, service-oriented architecture for integration into diverse processing environments.

## {metæffekt} Vulnerability Management

The known software components are matched against known security vulnerabilities from multiple sources to generate a
[Vulnerability Assessment Dashboard (HTML)](metaeffekt-vulnerability-assessment-dashboard/README.md) and Vulnerability Report (PDF).

This process involves three key phases:
The [Vulnerability Data Mirror](metaeffekt-vulnerability-management/data-mirror/vulnerability-data-mirror.md), the [Inventory Enrichment Pipeline](metaeffekt-vulnerability-management/inventory-enrichment/inventory-enrichment-pipeline.md) 
and the Dashboard & Report generation

## {metæffekt} Asset Descriptor

Asset descriptors are a way to parameterize more complex processing steps or the generation of documents. 
An asset descriptor is a .yaml file, which defined the inputs and adds additional metadata to these inputs. 
Based on such a configuration asset-descriptor-centric plugins can evaluate and process the information.

## {metæffekt} Kontinuum

The {metæffekt} Kontinuum combines {metæffekt} software and content into a set of modules that enable automation of license compliance management and vulnerability monitoring. 
It features precise scanning, a comprehensive license database, and vulnerability assessment tools.

 See for more details: [{metæffekt} Kontinuum](metaeffekt-kontinuum/README.md) 

## {metæffekt} Annex

The {metæffekt} Annex is a structured archive that documents and manages licensing obligations for software and hardware, including license terms, 
usage conditions, and source archives to support compliance, distribution, and operational use.
