# Inventory Enrichment Pipeline

> [Introduction](#introduction) -
> [Pipeline logs](#pipeline-logs)

## Introduction

The inventory enrichment process is responsible for transforming an input inventory of software components into an
enriched inventory that contains additional information about the components.
This information includes CPE URIs, vulnerability data, security advisories and other data.

The process uses a pipeline model to represent the individual steps involved, where each step can be enabled or disabled
as needed and can be configured with specific parameters.
Each step takes an inventory as input and outputs a modified inventory.
This allows for a modular and flexible approach to inventory enrichment, allowing to skip certain data providers.
The phases of the pipeline are broadly categorized in the [Phases](#phases) section of this chapter.
This pipeline can be constructed using the `enrich-inventory` goal of the `ae-inventory-enrichment-plugin` plugin
in a Maven POM, for which an [example is shown here](inventory-enrichment-steps.md).

All Inventory Enrichment steps with their configuration parameters:

- [Inventory Enrichment Steps](inventory-enrichment-steps.md)

Most of the inventory enrichment steps require an index from the
[vulnerability data mirror](../data-mirror/vulnerability-data-mirror.md) to be present.
The illustration below shows the data flow of an inventory through the inventory enrichment process.

## Pipeline logs

The logs of the enrichment process are quite interesting actually.

```java

All enrichment steps have been applied successfully:
 1. CPE URI derivation  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . [  2s 59ms]
 2. MSRC Vulnerabilities by Products  . . . . . . . . . . . [ 1s 928ms]
 3. NVD CVE from CPE  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . [    197ms]

```

Almost more interesting than that is the log when the process failed. It shows exactly where the error happened and
what resume-at ID to use if you want to retry from that step only.
