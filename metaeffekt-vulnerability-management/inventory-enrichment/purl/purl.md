## Introduction

PURL information on inventory artifacts can be used by the inventory enrichment in various ways.
Currently, the following steps in the software use PURLs:

- Open Source Vulnerabilities (OSV)
  - [Capabilities and integration](../../data-mirror/osv/osv.md)
  - [Process configuration](../inventory-enrichment-steps.md#package-url-derivation)

## Inventory Attributes

The following inventory artifact attributes are used for managing PURLs:

- `PURL`: Stores the set of PURLs defined by a user or automated process that created the inventory that should be enriched.
  If this value is set, the derivation of additional PURLs is skipped.
- `Inapplicable PURLs`: Allows users to specify PURLs that should be ignored for a particular artifact to enable false positive match prevention, for example via the correlation logic.
  Wildcards ("any value") are supported as well, see [Inapplicable PURLs](#inapplicable-purls) below for more information.
- `Derived PURLs`: Stores the set of PURLs automatically generated for an artifact by the [Purl Derivation](purl-derivation.md) enrichment step.

Internally, the `PurlUtil` class provides a centralized location for PURL-related logic, such as parsing, matching, and filtering.

### Inapplicable PURLs

The `Inapplicable PURLs` attribute on Artifacts is a CSV List of partially or fully defined PURLs that the artifact is not represented by.
`*` can be used as a wildcard on all fields except for the `type`, which does not allow the asterisk character, use `any` for the `type` instead.
Empty fields are treated as wildcards.

So, for example: `pkg:any/*/*`

### Effective PURLs

Similar to the [Effective CPE Parser](../../other-topics/parsing-effective-cpe.md), the multiple PURL inventory attributes can be evaluated to determine an effective set of PURLs to be used by the inventory enrichment steps.
This data becomes relevant in all steps where PURL information from the artifacts is required.

In pseudocode, this process works as follows:

```
Effective PURLs = isset(PURL) ? (PURL) : (Derived PURLs - Inapplicable PURLs)
```

Essentially, the `Derived PURLs` and `Inapplicable PURLs` are ignored as soon as at least one PURL is set in the `PURL` attribute.
Otherwise, the `Inapplicable PURLs` are subtracted from the `Derived PURLs`.
After this, a filtering action is performed to remove duplicates and reorder the PURLs.

The above-mentioned [Purl Derivation](purl-derivation.md) enrichment step respects these rules as well.
