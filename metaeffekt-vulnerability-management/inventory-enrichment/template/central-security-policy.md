The Central Security Policy Configuration manages various parameters about your environment that can change the way vulnerability information is aggregated or displayed in your reports.

This documentation page details all parameters individually and shows how to load your custom policy into the different processes.

## Usages

There are various processes at different points in the enrichment and reporting process in which a security policy is required to calculate the effective states of a vulnerability, define display settings or pass in other process configuration parameters.
This happens through the concept of a [Security Policy Loader](central-security-policy-loader.md) that parses a set of JSON files in a defined way.
You may visit the linked chapter to learn more about the structure and configuration of the loader.

A list of all plugins requiring a security policy is provided in the following list:
