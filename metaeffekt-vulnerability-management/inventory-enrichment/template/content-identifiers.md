## Overview

The Content Identifier structure is the way data providers are identified in our vulnerability monitoring.
Content Identifiers consist of a `name`, `display name`, `implementation` and an `ID pattern`.

- `name`: Unique identifiable name of the content source, should only contain `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`.
- `display name`: Will be used as a display name and should be human-readable.
- `implementation`: Specific implementation of the content source, may be left away if identical to the `name`.
  This describes the implementation class (type) of a content source and will overwrite the `name` when searching for an
  implementation class to allow for registering new content identifiers at runtime.
  When left empty, the name will be used as the implementation.
- `ID pattern`: Pattern to identify the content source by a representation of an identifier provided by the source of
  this content identifier.
  This pattern is optional and may be `UNDEFINED` if the content source does not provide a specific identifier pattern.
  If set, it can be used by different parts of the toolchain to identify the content source of a specific identifier.

There are three types of content identifiers:

- [Vulnerability Providers](#vulnerability-providers)
- [Security Advisories Providers](#security-advisories-providers)
- [Other Identifiers](#other-identifiers)

This distinction is made to allow for adding type-safe handling of the different content identifiers special fields.

An example for them being used in the `Referenced Advisories` or `Referenced Vulnerabilities` fields in the inventories
to model the relationship between the vulnerabilities and security advisories:

```json
[
  {
    "implementation": "MSRC",
    "name": "MSRC",
    "id": "MSRC-CVE-2023-50387"
  },
  {
    "implementation": "CERT_FR",
    "name": "CERT_FR",
    "id": "CERTFR-2024-AVI-0128"
  },
  {
    "implementation": "CERT_FR",
    "name": "CERT_FR",
    "id": "CERTFR-2024-AVI-0122"
  },
  {
    "implementation": "GHSA",
    "name": "GHSA",
    "id": "GHSA-8459-gg55-8qjj"
  }
]
```
