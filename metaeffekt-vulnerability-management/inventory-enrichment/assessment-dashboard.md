## Introduction

The Vulnerability Assessment Dashboard is a single-page HTML document that can be generated from an Inventory that went
through the [Vulnerability Inventory Enrichment Steps](inventory-enrichment-steps.md) and has aggregated vulnerability
information.
It visualizes this information in a way that allows for both gaining a quick overview over the components used and their
current vulnerabilities and security advisories, but also to delve into the details of the situation.

An Example can be seen below:

## Changes from version 3

#### Vulnerability Assessment Format

With the rollout of the new Dashboard, the assessment format has been updated to version 4.0 as well.
You can see all the changes in the
[vulnerability-assessment-file-gen-4.md](../other-topics/assessment/vulnerability-assessment-file-gen-4.md)
chapter.

To support the 3.x assessment format, these assessments are automatically converted to the new format.
The conversion is lossless and the resulting assessments should match up with older versions of the metaeffekt plugins.

#### Dashboard Data

A core concept behind the new dashboard was to have the full data model be transported into the HTML, and not have the
HTML be pre-rendered in the backend, such that the data can be adjusted at runtime to archive an integrative experience.

This allows for the interaction with a backend that manages users and accepts vulnerability assessments to be stored.

## Generation

You can use the `generate-vulnerability-dashboard` goal of the `ae-inventory-enrichment-plugin` to generate your
dashboard from an inventory.
