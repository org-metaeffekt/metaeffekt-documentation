## Overwriting version matching

By default, the process uses the `Version` field on the artifacts to match product cycles from the EOL data.
In some cases, this may not be desirable,
as the artifact version may be in a different format than the one in the EOL data.

There are two fields on artifacts that allow you to customize what versions are used to find the current cycle,
and one to find the latest version within a cycle.
In 95% of the cases, these must not be set as the data already reflects the real-world version usage,
but in cases such as on Microsoft Windows, the data differs.

These two fields are:

- `EOL Overwrite Cycle Query Version` e.g. `10-1809-e-lts`
- `EOL Overwrite Latest Version Query Version` e.g. `10.0.17763`

They can be extracted from the table below in the `Cycle` and `Latest` columns.
