## Introduction

Certain security advisories and vulnerabilities may provide information on known fixed software/hardware versions for affected components. These are then displayed on the detail pages in the dashboard.

## General Process

The extraction and display of fixed version information involve several stages within the enrichment pipeline.
The goal is to transport known fixed version information from security advisories on the entries in the inventory, and filter out data that is not relevant to the artifacts.

1. When vulnerability data is mirrored and parsed, specific "fixed" events are separated from the vulnerable version ranges.
2. During the vulnerability enrichment phase (advise), this fixed version data is transferred onto the vulnerability or security advisory objects within the inventory.
   The data is serialized into the `Version Ranges` column, to persist it through the pipeline.
3. To prevent the display of fixed versions for components or ecosystems that are not part of the analyzed project, a post-processing step in `inventoryPostProcessingEnrichment` filters the data by enabling the parameter `filterVulnerableSoftwareConfigurationsIrrelevantToInventory = true`.
   It cross-references the fixed configurations against the artifacts present in the inventory.
4. Finally, the dashboard reads the structured data from the `Version Ranges` column and renders it in a "Fixed Versions" section, grouping fixes by package name and ecosystem.

Example Data Structure in `Version Ranges`:

```json
[
  {
    "provider": {
      "implementation": "OSV",
      "name": "GHSA",
      "id": "GHSA-v435-xc8x-wvr9"
    },
    "ecosystem": "Maven",
    "name": "org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk18on",
    "purl": "pkg:maven/org.bouncycastle/bcprov-jdk18on",
    "fixedVersions": [
      {
        "vulnerable": false,
        "version": "1.78"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

## Supported Data Sources

Currently, the following data sources support the extraction of fixed software configurations:

### OSV (Open Source Vulnerabilities)

The OSV integration provides fixed versions by attaching them to the PURL-based matching they use.

1. In the Indexing step, the `OsvDataParser` processes the OSV data and identifies `fixed` events within the advisory.
   It stores these events in the `fixedVersions` list on the `VulnerableSoftwareConfiguration` object.
2. The `OsvVulnerabilitiesEnrichment` and `DetailsFillingEnrichmentOsv` steps process these fixed versions.
   If an advisory matches an artifact (based on PURL comparison), the available fixed version information is stored in the inventory under the `Version Ranges` column.
   This applies to both the direct OSV advisories and associated vulnerabilities (e.g. in cases of exclusion due to NVD equivalence).
3. The `inventoryPostProcessingEnrichment` cleans the collected data.
   This is achieved by checking the PURLs on the artifacts against the metadata in the fixed version entries.
