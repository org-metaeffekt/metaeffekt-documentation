# Downloaders

Downloaders are responsible for retrieving data from a remote source and storing it in a local directory.
The implementation of each downloader varies depending on the format of the data provided by the source
(e.g., JSON, XML).
Below is a list of all available downloaders, including deprecated ones.
Detailed information about each downloader can be found in the [Downloader Details](#downloader-details) section.

## General Downloading Workflow

Each downloader operates independently and can be executed using the `data-mirror` goal from the
`com.metaeffekt.artifact.analysis:ae-mirror-plugin`.
An example configuration is provided on the [Vulnerability Data Mirror](vulnerability-data-mirror.md) page.

While the downloaders have distinct implementations, they all follow a similar overall process.
Before actually running a download when triggered, they check if an update is needed.
The download step is skipped if no update is required.

A download is considered necessary if:

- The downloader has never been run before.
- The previous download attempt failed.
- The data is older than a configured threshold.
- The remote source has been updated since the last download. (not available for all downloaders)

Each downloader stores then its data in a single designated directory, with a format that depends on the downloader.

The remote resource locations can be configured by using the ResourceLocations configuration.
Every downloader makes its remote URLs available via this configuration, allowing hosting the data on different servers,
like a local mirror or a caching proxy.
All available resource locations are listed in the detailed downloader descriptions.
