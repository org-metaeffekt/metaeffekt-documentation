# Finding Microsoft Product Ids

## Introduction

As seen in the [understanding-data.md](understanding-data.md) chapter, it is not trivial to access the Microsoft data
without the knowledge of how the data is structured and how to interact with it.

One of the base elements of the Microsoft data is the `Product Id`, which identifies a single product in a certain
version and architecture in their database.
Finding this Product Id is not trivial for all products however.
This document aims to provide a guide on how to find the Product Id for a certain product.

## Windows as an OS

> The Windows versions have been specially processed in this documentation and can be found in the
> [Specific EOL Cycles](../eol/eol-data-specific-cycles.md) chapter.

Depending on what information you have, you might be able to skip ahead in this section.

If you only know your build number, such as `10.0.17763`, you will have to look up what version it corresponds to in
the internet.
I like to use Wikipedia for the:

- [Windows 10 Version History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10_version_history)
- [Windows 11 Version History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11_version_history)

In the example, `10.0.17763` corresponds to `Windows 10 Version 1809` (Redstone 5, October 2018 Update).

Using this information, you can now look up the Product Id for this version in your local index.

- You can find an example of how to do so in the
  [MsDataAccess#findMsProductId](../../documentation-generator/src/main/java/com/metaeffekt/documentation/example/MsDataAccess.java)
  method.  
  If you are interested in more methods to access the index, you can look at the [Index Examples](../index-examples.md).
- You can also use the Correlation Utilities if you have access to them. Use the mirror query widget with the
  `MSRC Products` query.

A filtered view of the results is the following:

| ID           |  Name                                                               | Vendor         | Family     |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|------------|
| 11673        | Windows 10 Version 1809 for HoloLens                                |  Windows       |  Microsoft |
| 11569        | Windows 10 Version 1809 for x64-based Systems                       |  Windows       |  Microsoft |

| 251-11569    | Windows Defender on Windows 10 Version 1809 for x64-based Systems   |  System Center |  Microsoft |

Now, to identify what id you need, you can look at the `Name` column and find the product you are looking for.
Specifically, make sure to pick the correct architecture and version.

## Other products

Pretty much the same goes for other products that you could be looking for.
Search for it using the query method and look at the results to find the correct Product Id.

For example, searching for `Office` will lead to these results:

```json
{"vendor":"Apps","name":"Office app","id":"11973","family":"Microsoft"}
{"vendor":"Microsoft Office","name":"Office Online Server","id":"10836","family":"Microsoft"}
{"vendor":"Microsoft Office","name":"Microsoft Office 365","id":"10134","family":"Microsoft"}
{"vendor":"Microsoft Office","name":"Microsoft Office Online Server","id":"11605","family":"Microsoft"}
{"vendor":"Microsoft Office","name":"Microsoft Office Word Viewer","id":"1160","family":"Microsoft"}
...
```
