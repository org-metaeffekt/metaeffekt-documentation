# {metæffekt} Vulnerability Assessment Dashboard

## Introduction

The {metæffekt} Vulnerability Assessment Dashboard (VAD) enables to get a consolidated view of all vulnerabilities
within a given Software or Hardware Asset. The VAD can be used to monitor vulnerabilities of the asset and to drive
assessments within an organization.

The process generating the VAD takes various data sources into account. On a general level:

- data for correlation and mapping of software components or hardware parts with vulnerability databases
- vulnerability data
- vulnerability alerts, notices, updates
- vulnerability advisory data
- vulnerability exploitation data
- vulnerability exploit prediction data
- end of life / end of service information

The VAD-generation process does never query specific vulnerability information online. The risk of
profile creation by external parties is regarded an information security issue for our customers. When information
is queried from online services the service providing party is able to create a protocol of queried vulnerabilities.
The concept for data aggregation by the VAD is therefore based on an organization-local mirror database. In regular
intervals the online data sources are synchronized into the local mirror, which renders the external access unspecific
to a given product or solution being examined.

After the aggregation the local dataset is consistently indexed and supplied to the VAD generation process. The indices
allow fast access to the data.

This aggregation and mirror concept is regarded a key feature of the {metæffekt} Kontinuum and differentiates the
{metæffekt} offerings from numerous other providers.

More details on the generation process including all configuration parameters are available in the
[Inventory Enrichment Steps](../metaeffekt-vulnerability-management/inventory-enrichment/inventory-enrichment-steps.md#vulnerability-assessment-dashboard)
section of the Vulnerability Management documentation.

## Data Sources

A detailed list of all data sources can be found in the
[Data Mirror > Downloaders](../metaeffekt-vulnerability-management/data-mirror/download.md) section.
For an overview of how the different data sources contribute to the generation process, see the
[Overview Diagrams](../metaeffekt-vulnerability-management/diagrams/individual-index-diagrams.md) section.

The full set of datasource currently supported can be found [here](../metaeffekt-vulnerability-management/vulnerability-data-sources.md).
